# Dataset Information

## Raw Dataset

The raw EEG dataset (`data.csv`) is **NOT included** in this repository due to its large size (7.6 MB).

### Download Instructions

**Dataset Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Epileptic Seizure Recognition](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition)

**Alternative Source:** [Kaggle - Epileptic Seizure Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harunshimanto/epileptic-seizure-recognition)

### Setup

1. Download `data.csv` from one of the sources above
2. Place it in the **project root directory** (same level as `src/` and `docs/`)
3. The file should be located at: `BDPA_BSAI5A_192_216_232/../data.csv`

### Dataset Structure

- **Total Samples:** 11,500
- **Features:** 178 time-series values (EEG signal)
- **Labels:** 5 classes (1-5)
  - Class 1: Seizure Activity
  - Class 2: Tumor Area Recording
  - Class 3: Healthy Brain Area
  - Class 4: Eyes Closed
  - Class 5: Eyes Open

## Processed Data Files

The following processed data files **ARE included** in this repository:

### 1. `processed_eeg_features.csv` (1.3 MB)
- Extracted features from raw EEG signals
- Used by the foundation model pipeline

### 2. `subject_wise_features.csv` (182 KB)
- Subject-aggregated features
- Generated by `src/subject_wise_ml.py`
- Contains ~23-25 features per subject:
  - Statistical features (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis, etc.)
  - Frequency band powers (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
  - Temporal features (zero-crossing rate)
  - Energy features

## Data Preprocessing

Both scripts (`subject_wise_ml.py` and `eeg_foundation_model.py`) perform:

1. **Subject-aware splitting** - Ensures no subject overlap between train/test sets
2. **Feature scaling** - StandardScaler normalization
3. **Label adjustment** - Converts 1-5 labels to 0-4 for PyTorch (DL model only)

For more details, see the scripts in `src/` directory.
